Bugs, Please
============

I'm working on a big update to [Papers, Please](http://papersplea.se) that includes:

- A Linux version
- Lots of bug fixes to the current public version (1.0.41)
- Localizations
    - French
    - Italian
    - German
    - Spanish
    - Portuguese (Brazilian)
    - Russian (not complete yet)
    - Japanese (not complete yet)
- A software rendering mode
- (No new content)

Right now, everything's mostly done, but it hasn't been tested well. Adding localization support took a long time and required changes to almost every system in the game. The software rendering mode is a hopeful solution to the many OpenGL-related problems that Windows users have. The Linux version is a whole new OS. Because so much has changed from version 1.0.41, I need help to test this new build!

### How to Help

If you'd like to help, you'll need:
- To have completed the game already (on any previous version)
- A Steam account
- A github.com account to report issues

Send me an email at **helptest [at] papersplea [dot] se** that includes your github name and I'll set you up with password access to a super secret hidden beta branch of the game on Steam \*. Then you just need to play the new build and report any bugs or problems you have by [opening an issue here](https://github.com/dukope/BugsPlease/issues). If you previously played a friend's copy or a non-Steam build, and you have some prior experience testing games, mention that in your email and I'll give you a Steam code for testing.

\* I'll probably limit the number of players on this new build so I can stay on top of any reported issues. If you'd like to help, email me soon!

### Kinds of Bugs

In general, these are the kinds of things to look out for:
- Unlocalized text
- Localized text that doesn't fit
- Crashes
- Problems with the Linux version
- Problems with the savegames
- Gameplay logic bugs (discrepancies that aren't, correlations that aren't, etc)
- Visual bugs (especially in the new software rendering mode)

If you're playing in a non-English language also keep an eye out for confusing or wrong localizations. It could be a problem with the localization system or the translated text. The people who translated the game text are extremely good but there's always a chance that we missed something.

### Experimental

This semi-private test is a bit of an experiment. I don't know how well it'll go. If it spirals out of orbit then we can wave goodbye with both hands. Though, I'm currently a little worried that the game might be too buggy to unleash publicly. A more private test like this seems like a better idea than just releasing it and hoping for the best.

### Or Not

If you're not interested in testing, don't worry! Everything should hopefully be ironed out in a few weeks and the new version will be available for everyone. In fact, if you haven't played through the entire game yet, you should wait until then anyways. I wouldn't want a game-stopping bug to spoil your first playthrough.


Thanks!
