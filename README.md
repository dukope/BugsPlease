Bugs, Please
============

The latest version of [Papers, Please](http://papersplea.se) as been updated to include:

- A Linux version
- Lots of bug fixes to the current public version (1.0.41)
- Localizations
    - French
    - Italian
    - German
    - Spanish
    - Portuguese (Brazilian)
    - Russian
    - Japanese
- A software rendering mode
- (No new content)

Adding localization support took a long time and required changes to almost every system in the game. The software rendering mode is a hopeful solution to the many OpenGL-related problems that Windows users have. The Linux version is a whole new OS.

### Problems?

If you have any problems running the game and you'd like to help, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/dukope/BugsPlease/issues) with lots of details.

Thanks!
